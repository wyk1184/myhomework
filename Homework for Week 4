Group E How to handle loops in CFT?

The CFG is the construction  of the CFT,there are some loops in CFG,loop is repetitive or iterative process.
Loop has specification,which are deterministic , nondeterministic and individual loop.It is important  how to select 
loop testing,heuristics and concrete measures boundary related problems more likely to select.For the hierarchical modeling
,the test loop in isolation first and collapse loop as a single node in higher level models.As white box testing 
use it more offen,such as small programs during unit testing,coarse-grain system level model.But as black box testing use
it less.And for the loop testing we shlould find critical values.
